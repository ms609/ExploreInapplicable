This directory contains individual summary histograms for each analysis for each dataset.
The subdirectories `landscape` and `portrait` combine the panels to create a single
figure for each dataset, in the respective orientations.

The file `Sansom2010-extraState-5in.pdf` takes the trees that are optimal when the Sansom 
_et al_. 2010 dataset is analysed under each of the three methods, and re-scores each
of these trees under the "extra state" scoring.  

The "extra state" trees, of course, all receive the same (optimal) score.  But the trees that
were optimal under other methods may receive lower scores when they are scored using the 
"extra state" method.  If trees are optimal under one method and profoundly suboptimal
under another, then method choice has a large impact on phylogenetic results.

(The `5in` suffix simply denotes that the figures are produced at a nominal size of 5 × 5 inches.)
