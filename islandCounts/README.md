# Island Counts
Each of these plots depicts the results of the dataset named in its filename.

The dataset has been analysed under four different methods; for each method, an 'island' of
optimal (most parimonious) trees has been collected.

Each tree on each of these islands has then been scored under each of the other three methods.

Each graph describes how much longer the trees on the island in question are than the optimal
tree under eaech of the three alternative methods.
