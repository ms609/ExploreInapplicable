This folder contains the raw morphological matrices analysed in this study, which 
were selected from the literature with a view to obtaining a broad coverage
of taxa and taxonomic levels.

Matrices with a trivial amount of inapplicable tokens (e.g. max 2 per transformation series)
were excluded, as were those with large numbers of taxa (>80), for computational reasons.

Comments and additional blocks were removed from the matrices to allow their easy parsing by
different software packages.  Nexus-formatted "comment" blocks occur after the matrices
in a small number of files.
