For each matrix:

  Classify each ontogenetically depedent character as neomorphic or transformational [big job]
    Create text file for each matrix, listing N or T for each character in turn
  
  Copy matrix, replacing neomorphic/transformational inapplicables with: [perl - easy]
    
    1a. ?/?  - ambiguous
    1b. 0/?  - ambigAbsent
             
    2.  0/9  - extraState
             
    3.  0/-  - inapplicable
    
  Cases 1a, 1b, 2: [ do in the above perl script ]
  
    Conduct comprehensive TNT search
    
  Case 3: [ Probably do one by one in R, to supervise completion ]
    
    Conduct comprehensive tree search in R::inapplicable
    Calculate scores of optimal trees from cases 1a, 1b, 2
    
  Read all MPTs by all methods into R
  
  For each tree,   
    Determine whether it's an MPT under each method
    
  Draw Venn Diagram showing size and overlap of MPT islands between methods.
